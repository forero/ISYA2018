## Course title: Python Basics for Astronomy and Astrophysics

## Lecturer: Jaime E. Forero-Romero, Universidad de los Andes (Colombia)

Description: Python has become a de facto standard in scientific computing. It is open source, easy to learn with and has a rich ecosystem of libraries.
It has also become the language of choice for many astronomical communities and projects.
Furthermore, python skills are a valuable asset for astronomers looking for industry jobs (inside and outside astronomy.)
In this series of lectures we will cover the basics of python together with the most popular libraries for scientific computing, visualization, data analysis and basic astronomy/astrophysics computations.
