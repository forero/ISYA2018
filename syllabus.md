## Course title: Python Basics for Astronomy and Astrophysics

## Lecturer: Jaime E. Forero-Romero, Universidad de los Andes (Colombia)

Description: Python has become a de facto standard in scientific computing.
It has also become the language of choice for many astronomical communities and projects.
Furthermore, python skills are an asset for astronomers looking for industry jobs (inside and outside astronomy.)
